How to get the server(s) run:

0. All .java files are located in the src folder at the top level of the .zip file.
A bin folder at the top level of the .zip file will contain all .class files after compiling.
Lobby.java is the main class of our project including the main method.

1. Compile the .java files included in the src folder at the top level of the .zip file
using the following command line:

mkdir bin; javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/Lobby.java


2. Starting a server on the local machine by launching Lobby.java using the following command line:

java -cp bin Lobby

To assign a port to the server simply insert it into the command line prompt.


3. To connect local server(s) to modestchecker.net use the following command line as stated in the project documentation:

connect modestchecker.net 42015

To connect two local servers with eachother use different ports:

connect localserver [port]
